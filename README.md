Real-time Hand gesture translator using machine learning. This application is working with the help of machine learning models, computer vision algorithms. This application converts hand gestures shown on the live video feed to text and the text will be spoken with the help of NLP. Data for the training of this application is captured from the live video feed of the web cam. Future application of this app is that this can be integrated with live video calling applications.
